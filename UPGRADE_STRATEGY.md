## 4. Naming Strategy

### Recommended Name: **"PrayAI"**

#### Tier 3 (Consider)

        data: { screen: "devotional" },
      },
      trigger: {
        hour,

#### **3. Audio Playback**

**Recommendation: react-native-track-player**

```bash
npm install react-native-track-player
```

**Why:**

- Background playback
- Lock screen controls
- Offline caching
- Playback speed
- Sleep timer

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// src/services/audioBibleService.ts

import TrackPlayer, {
  Capability,
  Event,
  State,
} from "react-native-track-player";

export class AudioBibleService {
  async initialize() {
    await TrackPlayer.setupPlayer();

    await TrackPlayer.updateOptions({
      capabilities: [
        Capability.Play,
        Capability.Pause,
        Capability.SkipToNext,
        Capability.SkipToPrevious,
        Capability.Stop,
      ],
      compactCapabilities: [Capability.Play, Capability.Pause],
    });
  }

  async playChapter(book: string, chapter: number) {
    const audioUrl = await this.getAudioUrl(book, chapter);

    await TrackPlayer.add({
      id: `${book}-${chapter}`,
      url: audioUrl,
      title: `${book} ${chapter}`,
      artist: "Bible Audio (NIV)",
      artwork: require("@/assets/images/bible-audio-art.png"),
    });

    await TrackPlayer.play();
  }

  async setSleepTimer(minutes: number) {
    setTimeout(
      async () => {
        await TrackPlayer.pause();
      },
      minutes * 60 * 1000,
    );
  }
}
```

---

#### **4. Payment Processing**

**Recommendation: RevenueCat**

**Why:**

- Handles iOS App Store and Google Play subscriptions
- Cross-platform subscription management
- Real-time webhooks to update user status
- Built-in analytics
- Free tier up to $2.5K MRR

```bash
npm install react-native-purchases
```

**Setup:**

```typescript
// src/services/subscriptionService.ts

import Purchases, { PurchasesOffering } from "react-native-purchases";

export class SubscriptionService {
  async initialize() {
    Purchases.configure({
      apiKey: REVENUECAT_API_KEY,
      appUserID: userId,
    });
  }

  async getOfferings(): Promise<PurchasesOffering> {
    const offerings = await Purchases.getOfferings();
    return offerings.current;
  }

  async purchasePremium(packageId: string) {
    try {
      const purchaseResult = await Purchases.purchasePackage(packageId);

      if (purchaseResult.customerInfo.entitlements.active["premium"]) {
        // User is now premium
        await this.updateUserPremiumStatus(true);
        return true;
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
      return false;
    }
  }

  async restorePurchases() {
    const customerInfo = await Purchases.restorePurchases();
    const isPremium = customerInfo.entitlements.active["premium"] !== undefined;
    await this.updateUserPremiumStatus(isPremium);
    return isPremium;
  }

  async checkSubscriptionStatus() {
    const customerInfo = await Purchases.getCustomerInfo();
    return customerInfo.entitlements.active["premium"] !== undefined;
  }
}
```

**In-App Purchase Products (Apple/Google):**

```
Product IDs:
- prayai_premium_monthly ($12.99/month)
- prayai_premium_annual ($89.99/year)
- prayai_premium_lifetime ($199.99 one-time)

Subscription Groups:
- Premium Subscriptions (auto-renewing)
```

---

#### **5. Analytics & Tracking**

**Recommendation: PostHog (Open-Source Analytics)**

**Why:**

- Open-source, GDPR-compliant
- Tracks events, user journeys, funnels
- Session recording (optional)
- Feature flags for A/B testing
- Free tier generous (1M events/month)

```bash
npm install posthog-react-native
```

**Key Events to Track:**

```typescript
// User Engagement
- app_opened
- screen_viewed (which screen)
- devotional_read
- prayer_created
- verse_saved

- day_7_retention
- day_30_retention
```

---

#### **6. Bible API Service**

**Current:** None (need to add)

**Recommendation: API.Bible + Bible.org API**

**API.Bible** (Official USFM API):

- ESV, CSB, KJV, NASB official APIs
- Audio Bible endpoints
- Free tier: 500 requests/day
- Paid tier: $19/month for 100K requests

**Bible.org API** (NET Bible):

- Free and open
- Study notes included
- Good for cross-references

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// src/services/bibleApiService.ts

export class BibleApiService {
  private apiKey = process.env.BIBLE_API_KEY;
  private baseUrl = "https://api.scripture.api.bible/v1";

  async getVerse(reference: string, translation: string = "NIV") {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${this.baseUrl}/bibles/${translation}/verses/${reference}`,
      {
        headers: {
          "api-key": this.apiKey,
        },
      },
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.content;
  }

  async getChapter(book: string, chapter: number, translation: string = "NIV") {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${this.baseUrl}/bibles/${translation}/chapters/${book}.${chapter}`,
      {
        headers: {
          "api-key": this.apiKey,
        },
      },
    );
    return await response.json();
  }

  async getAudioChapter(book: string, chapter: number) {
    // API.Bible audio endpoints
    const response = await fetch(
      `${this.baseUrl}/bibles/NIV/chapters/${book}.${chapter}/audio`,
      {
        headers: {
          "api-key": this.apiKey,
        },
      },
    );
    return await response.json();
  }

  async searchVerses(query: string, translation: string = "NIV") {
    const response = await fetch(
      `${this.baseUrl}/bibles/${translation}/search?query=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`,
      {
        headers: {
          "api-key": this.apiKey,
        },
      },
    );
    return await response.json();
  }
}
```

**Caching Strategy:**

- Cache verses in SQLite after first fetch
- Offline-first: serve from cache, update in background
- Clear cache on translation change

---

#### **7. Image Sharing Service**

**For creating shareable verse images (Instagram/Facebook)**

```bash
npm install react-native-view-shot
npm install @react-native-community/cameraroll
```

**Implementation:**

```typescript
// src/services/verseImageService.ts

import ViewShot from 'react-native-view-shot';
import * as Sharing from 'expo-sharing';

export class VerseImageService {
  async createVerseImage(verse: string, reference: string) {
    // Component to render
    const VerseImageComponent = (
      <LinearGradient colors={['#667eea', '#764ba2']}>
        <Text style={styles.verse}>"{verse}"</Text>
        <Text style={styles.reference}>{reference}</Text>
        <Text style={styles.watermark}>PrayAI App</Text>
      </LinearGradient>
    );

    // Capture as image
    const uri = await this.captureRef.capture({
      format: 'png',
      quality: 1,
    });

    return uri;
  }

  async shareVerseImage(imageUri: string) {
    if (await Sharing.isAvailableAsync()) {
      await Sharing.shareAsync(imageUri);
    }
  }
}
```

**Templates:**

- 5-10 gradient backgrounds
- Different font styles
- Seasonal themes (Christmas, Easter, etc.)

---

### Security Improvements

**Critical Issues to Fix:**

1. **Exposed API Key** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

```typescript
// CURRENT (BAD):
const API_KEY = "AIzaSyDCMEoUoBAd0TUiCWiyO9JBDYCe_mD5wpc"; // EXPOSED!

// SOLUTION: Move to environment variables + backend proxy
- Create backend proxy endpoint for Gemini AI calls
- Never expose API keys in client code
- Use Supabase Edge Functions to call Gemini
```

**Backend Proxy Example:**

```typescript
// Supabase Edge Function: functions/gemini-proxy/index.ts

import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts";
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from "@google/generative-ai";

serve(async (req) => {
  const { prompt, userId } = await req.json();

  // Verify user authentication
  const authHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization");
  if (!authHeader) return new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 });

  // Check rate limits (prevent abuse)
  const rateLimit = await checkRateLimit(userId);
  if (!rateLimit.allowed) {
    return new Response("Rate limit exceeded", { status: 429 });
  }

  // Call Gemini AI securely
  const apiKey = Deno.env.get("GEMINI_API_KEY");
  const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey);
  const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp" });

  const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
  const response = result.response.text();

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ response }), {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });
});
```

**Client Update:**

```typescript
// src/services/geminiService.ts (NEW)

export class GeminiService {
  async generateContent(prompt: string) {
    const response = await fetch(`${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/gemini-proxy`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${userToken}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ prompt }),
    });
    return await response.json();
  }
}
```

---

2. **Rate Limiting**

Prevent abuse of AI features:

```typescript
// Implement in Supabase Edge Functions

const rateLimits = {
  free: {
    chatbot: 10, // messages per day
    verseSearch: 10, // searches per day
    prayerGeneration: 3, // prayers per day
  },
  premium: {
    chatbot: -1, // unlimited
    verseSearch: -1,
    prayerGeneration: -1,
  },
};

async function checkRateLimit(userId: string, feature: string) {
  const tier = await getUserTier(userId);
  const limit = rateLimits[tier][feature];

  if (limit === -1) return { allowed: true }; // Unlimited

  const usage = await getUsageToday(userId, feature);
  return {
    allowed: usage < limit,
    remaining: limit - usage,
  };
}
```

---

3. **Data Privacy**

- All journal entries encrypted at rest
- User can delete all data permanently
- GDPR compliance (EU users)
- Privacy policy and terms of service

```typescript
// Encrypt sensitive data before storing

import * as Crypto from "expo-crypto";

export async function encryptJournalEntry(content: string) {
  const key = await getEncryptionKey(userId);
  const encrypted = await Crypto.digestStringAsync(
    Crypto.CryptoDigestAlgorithm.SHA256,
    content + key,
  );
  return encrypted;
}
```

---

### Performance Optimizations

**1. Lazy Loading**

- Load screens on-demand
- React.lazy() for heavy components

**2. Image Optimization**

- Use expo-image for better performance
- Cache images locally
- WebP format for smaller sizes

**3. Database Indexing**

```sql
-- Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_journal_entries_user_id ON journal_entries(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_saved_verses_user_id ON saved_verses(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_prayer_requests_circle_id ON prayer_requests(circle_id);
```

**4. Code Splitting**

- Separate large libraries into chunks
- On-demand loading for premium features

---

**4. AI Costs**

- _Risk:_ Gemini API costs explode as users grow
- _Mitigation:_
  - Rate limiting for free users
  - Prompt optimization to reduce tokens
  - Switch to cheaper model if needed (Claude Haiku)
  - Cache common responses

**5. Low Conversion Rate**

- _Risk:_ Free users don't convert to premium
