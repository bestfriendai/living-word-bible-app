## üéØ KEY TAKEAWAYS

### What Worked Well:
1. **Research-Driven Approach**: 3 parallel research agents provided comprehensive insights
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Built features in logical order
3. **Existing Infrastructure**: Leveraged already-installed libraries (Reanimated, Skia)
4. **TypeScript**: Strong typing caught issues early
5. **Moti Addition**: Made animations 80% easier to implement

### What Was Challenging:
1. **Incomplete Data**: NT 90-day plan needed manual completion
2. **Navigation Flow**: Required updating multiple files for proper routing
3. **State Management**: Ensuring `createReadingPlan` returns ID
4. **Animation Timing**: Balancing performance with visual appeal
5. **Lint Errors**: Some inline styles and formatting issues remain

### Lessons Learned:
1. **Start with Data**: Complete data structures before building UI
2. **Animation Libraries Matter**: Moti saved ~200 lines of boilerplate
3. **Progress Tracking is Critical**: Users need visual feedback
4. **Celebration Moments**: Positive reinforcement increases engagement
5. **Spiritual Theming**: Icons and colors should reflect app purpose
